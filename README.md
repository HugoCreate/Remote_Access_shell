# Remote_Access_shell
A python code that comes in 2 parts:
- A code that fowards your PCs port so it can be accessed from the internet (with security login page and a 3 password attempt limit. If failing 3 times the program ends and needs to be restarted)
- A code that connects to the first one and allows the user to attempt a password. If it succeeds, a shell space is created to the user access the shell enviroment of the PC.
